This theoretical semester project involves the examination and the implementation of the numerical
renormalisation group method (NRG). It is a technique which plays a key role in solving many-body systems
that contain quantum impurities. In this report, the method was applied on the Anderson impurity model
(AIM), giving numerical results which were achieved with the programming language "Python". The fact,
that it is possible to obtain the energy spectrum of the AIM-hamiltonian for a many-body system with a huge
number of component particles and states, is quite striking. Indeed, the lowest energy states showing an
asymptotic behaviour will be presented further on.
